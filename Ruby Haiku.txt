Ruby Haiku --
Even "old geeks" find wonder in this language. I'd like to contribute!

"Ruby.new" breathed Matz

Nay! don't choose the snake!           (... do Python!)
  That parrot is dead and gone.
Beauty's in the gems.

-----

Agile develops.
  Ruby delights programmers.
Thus great tools are born.

-----

That methods are missed
  concerns not introspection --
Metaprogramming.

-----

Need to count something?
  Iterate. Enumerate.
Ruby tallies all.

The little old gal,
  rebuffed by old Doc Russell,
next came to hear Matz.

"Make coders happy!
  Dynamic! Introspection!"
declared Ruby's dad...

"You cannot fool me!
  It's Objects all the way down..."
she quipped with a grin.

# AskPrompted returns a +true+ (boolean) if the user enters an affirmative
# '[Yy]...' response to the prompt, or returns a +false+ response (boolean)
# if the user enters a negative '[Nn]...' response (or any non-affirmative
# response); the +default+ response can be set to either "Y" or "N" ("Y" is
# the default +default+).
# Prompt-termination punctuation is a question mark "?".
# For example:
#   if askprompted( "Continue" ) then ...
#   if askprompted( "Continue", "N" ) then...
def askprompted( prompt, default = "Y" )
  # expects a Yes or No response,
  # returns true for any response beginning with "Y" or "y",
  # returns false for everything else...
  # but does test & respond to exit/quit/Ctrl-D/Ctrl-Z...

# Dependency: Uses Ruby *Random* standard library module (available since v2.x).
#
# Provides the means to shuffle, scramble or thoroughly mix-up a collection of
# arbitrary objects, to randomly retrieve (e.g., "deal") a collection which is
# read in a predictable order.  The physical analogy is to "shuffle a deck of
# playing cards" and then to "deal" the cards one-at-a-time, or to "shake up a
# bag of marbles" and then to choose the marbles one-at-a-time.
#
# Relies on two instance variables:
#   @pile : A hash which collects the objects, associating each stored object
#           (the Value) with a random number (its Key)
#   @deck : An array which receives a sorted version of the @pile hash, thus
#           presenting its elements as a sorted list of [rand#,object] pairs
#
# Because, as each Value object is @pile-stored, it is associated with a unique
# (and potentially different for each run) random number, and then the @pile is
# sorted into the @deck, that sort serves as a kind of "reverse-shuffle" so
# that as Values are retrieved by sorted (random) Key from the @deck-array,
# they are retrieved in random order, distinct from the order in which they
# were stored.
#
# Instance variables:
#
#    @pile       : A hash which collects the (unrandomized) collection objects
#    @deck       : An array which is the randomized collection
#    @deckindex  : Initially nil to indicate that objects are being collected
#                  into the @pile and that @deck has not yet been "randomized"
#                  (sorted)
#    @seed       : An integer which, if provided as the *optional* parameter to
#                  Scramble.new, provides a known seed value to Random, thus
#                  producing a repeatable random sequence (useful for testing
#                  and verification).
#    @randgen    : An instance of Random for this instance of Scramble.  If a
#                  fixed seed is not provided to Scramble.new, then each instance
#                  of Scramble runs with a unique (pseudo)Random number sequence;
#                  a specific, shared seed value puts each instance on the same
#                  (pseudo)Random sequence.
#    @collisions : An internal bookkeeping counter, just to see if random numbers
#                  reoccur which would cause hash table (key) collisions.  Reported
#                  only by to_s, and just for information.
#
# For convenience, +@pile+, +@deck+, +@deckindex+, +@seed+ and +@collisions+ are
# exposed as read-only attributes of the class.

class Scramble

# Provides the means to shuffle, scramble or thoroughly mix-up a collection of
# arbitrary objects, to randomly retrieve (e.g., "deal") a collection which is
# read in a predictable order.  The physical analogy is to "shuffle a deck of
# playing cards" and then to "deal" the cards one-at-a-time, or to "shake up a
# bag of marbles" and then to choose the marbles one-at-a-time.
#
# Relies on two instance variables:
#    @bag : A Hash which collects the objects, associating each stored
#           object (the Value) with a random number (its Key)
#   @sack : An Array which receives a sorted version of the @bag hash,
#           thus presenting its elements as a sorted list of [rand,obj]
#           pairs
#
# Because, as each Value object is @bag-stored, it is associated with a unique
# (and potentially different for each run) random number, and then the @bag is
# sorted into the @sack, that sort serves as a kind of "reverse-shuffle" so
# that as Values are retrieved by sorted (random) Key from the @sack-array,
# they are retrieved in random order, distinct from the order in which they
# were stored.

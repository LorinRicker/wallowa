# Note: A thousands method is defined for both Numeric and String
#       Classes, as it's feasible and expected to see invocations
#       of it for both 1234567890.thousands and "123456".thousands
#       instances (for both strings and numeric values).  Hence,
#       the Numeric.thousands is simply a wrapper, with a to_s
#       conversion, around String.thousands.

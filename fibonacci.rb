# This recursive algorithm works in exponential time, with O(N**m)
# costs beginning to be noticeable on fast processors at ~ Fib(32):
def fibonacci_slow( n )
  return n if (0..1).include? n
  fibonacci_slow( n-2 ) + fibonacci_slow( n-1 )
end  # fibonacci

# But this memoized algorithm is simply linear -- it works by
# remembering all previous results for subsequent look-up,
# even though the actual algorithm remains recursive, trading
# (re)computation for memory...  Thanks to:

Heisenberg and Schroedinger are driving, and get pulled over.

Heisenberg is in the driver's seat, the officer asks
"Do you know how fast you were going?"

Heisenberg replies, "No, but I know exactly where I am!"

The officer looks at him confused and says "You were going 108 miles per hour!"

Heisenberg throws his arms up and cries, "Great! Now I'm lost!"

The officer, now more confused and frustrated orders the men outside of the car,
and proceeds to inspect the vehicle. He opens the trunk and yells at the two men,
"Hey! Did you guys know you have a dead cat back here?"

Schroedinger angrily yells back, "We do now, asshole!"

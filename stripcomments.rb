# Strips (removes) comment lines from a source-code file; removes both
#   stand-alone (single-line) comments and those embedded in source lines.
# Uses STDIN and STDOUT, filenames on com-line, including redirection,
#   so this program can be used as a filter in a pipeline...
#
# Usage:  $ ./stripcomments [infile] [outfile]
#         $ ./stripcomments foo.rb                  # output to STDOUT
#         $ ./stripcomments foo.rb foo.nocomments
#         $ ./stripcomments <foo.rb >foo.nocomments
#         $ cat foo.rb | ./stripcomments | wc -l

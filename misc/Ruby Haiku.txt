Ruby Haiku:

require 'a_gem'
  the_joy.in the_beautiful
"Ruby.new" breathed Matz

Even "old geeks" find wonder in this language. I'd like to contribute!

Nay! don't choose the snake!  (... do Python!)
  That parrot is dead and gone.
Beauty's in the gems.

Agile develops.
  Ruby delights programmers.
Thus great tools are born.

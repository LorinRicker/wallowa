Ruby Haiku (5,7,5) --

Even old geeks find
  the wonder in this language.
May I contribute?

-----

No Fences; no Walls.
  Ruby makes coders happy!
No Windows; no Gates!

-----

require 'a_gem'
  the_joy.in the_beauty
"Ruby.new" breathed Matz

-----

Nay! don't choose the snake!           (... do Python!)
  That parrot is dead and gone.
Beauty's in the gems.

-----

Agile develops.
  Ruby delights programmers.
Thus great tools are born.

-----

That methods are missed
  concerns not introspection --
Metaprogramming.

-----

Need to count something?
  Iterate. Enumerate.
Ruby tallies all.

-----

The little old gal,
  rebuffed by old Doc Russell,
next came to hear Matz.

"Make coders happy!
  Dynamic! Introspection!"
declared Ruby's dad...

"You cannot fool me!
  It's Objects all the way down..."
she quipped with a grin.

-----

With deepest apologies to The Bard (paraphrasing
"As You Like It", Act II Scene VII, Jaques' monologue):

All the world's a String,
  And all the men and women
merely characters.

A not-so-haiku, with deepest respect to Stan Kelly-Bootle (1929-2014, RIP):

v1.0
recursive  adj.  See Recursive.

v2.0
recursive  adj.  while (unclear) {
                   unclear--;
                   See Recursive
                 }
